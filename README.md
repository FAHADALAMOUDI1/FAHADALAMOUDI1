# Hey-there :wave:

:fast_forward: Hi, I’m Fahad Alamoudi, a Software Engineering graduate with a strong interest in software development, IT support, and data analysis. I enjoy building practical applications, supporting users with technical issues, and working with data to create clear and useful reports.

I have experience with web technologies and office systems, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Microsoft Office. I’m comfortable with basic troubleshooting, data organization, and software testing, and I like turning problems into simple, effective digital solutions.

I’m always eager to learn, improve my skills, and contribute to teams that value efficiency, reliability, and continuous growth. :computer:
